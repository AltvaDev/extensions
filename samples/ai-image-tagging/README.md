# AI Image Tagging

This extension enables automatic tagging of images. To use, configure it in the
Sidebar of a content type that includes two fields at minimum:

 - A `Media` field to serve as the image source
 - A `Short text, list` field to store the generated tags

 To use, just add an image to your image field and click `Auto-tag image`. The generated
 tags should be added to your tags field once ready.
